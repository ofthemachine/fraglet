# fraglet-entrypoint configuration
# This file configures how fraglets are injected and executed within a container.

# Temporary location where the fraglet code is written before injection
# The fraglet code is read from this path and injected into the target file
#
# *** IMPORTANT ***
# This is the interface between the fraglet and the container, and users of
# fraglet compatible containers must mount this path to the fraglet code.
#
# Default: /FRAGLET
fragletTempPath: /FRAGLET

# Injection configuration: how fraglet code is inserted into the target file
injection:
  # Full path to the target file where fraglet code will be injected
  codePath: /code/hello-world.sh

  # Injection marker: the fraglet code replaces the entire line containing this string
  # The matched line is completely replaced with the fraglet code (indentation preserved)
  # For region-based injection, use match_start and match_end instead
  # Default: FRAGLET
  match: FRAGLET

  # Alternative: region-based injection (both must be specified together)
  # match_start: "# BEGIN_FRAGLET"
  # match_end: "# END_FRAGLET"
  # All lines from match_start through match_end (inclusive) are replaced with fraglet code

# Path to agent-help markdown file (displayed via "agent-help" command)
# The file is first checked at this absolute path, then in the code directory
agentHelp: /agent-help.md

# Path to how-to markdown file (displayed via "how-to" command)
# The file is first checked at this absolute path, then in the code directory
howTo: /how-to.md

# Execution configuration: how the code is executed after injection
execution:
  # Command/path to execute. If specified, executes: path [args...]
  # If omitted, executes: args[0] [args[1:]...] (treats command-line args as the command)
  #
  # Examples:
  #   path: /code/hello-world.sh
  #     → Executes: /code/hello-world.sh [all command-line args]
  #
  #   path: python /code/script.py
  #     → Executes: python /code/script.py [all command-line args]
  #
  #   path: (omitted)
  #     → Executes: [first arg] [remaining args...]
  #     → Example: entrypoint ls -la → executes: ls -la
  path: /code/hello-world.sh

  # Whether to make the execution path executable (default: true)
  # Note: If executing a file directly (not via interpreter), this MUST be true
  # or execution will fail. Set to false only when using interpreter commands
  # like "python /path/to/script.py" or "bash /path/to/script.sh"
  makeExecutable: true
